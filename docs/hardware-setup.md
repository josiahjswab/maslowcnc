# Hardware Setup Guide

This comprehensive guide covers the setup and configuration of both Chain Maslow and Belt Maslow (M4) machines, helping you choose the right system and get it properly configured.

## Maslow CNC System Overview

### Chain Maslow (Original System)
The original Maslow design uses chains and sprockets to control sled movement across a vertical work surface.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Large work area**: Typically 4' × 8' (1220mm × 2440mm)
- **Vertical orientation**: Wall-mounted or easel-style frame
- **Chain-driven**: Uses motorcycle chains and sprockets
- **Ring system**: Triangular linkage or ring kit connects chains to sled

### Belt Maslow (M4)
The newer Belt Maslow uses timing belts instead of chains, offering improved precision and reduced maintenance.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Compact design**: More suitable for smaller workshops
- **Belt-driven**: Uses timing belts for smoother operation
- **Improved accuracy**: Better positioning precision than chains
- **Easier calibration**: Simplified setup process

## Choosing Your Maslow System
