# Firmware Update Connection Troubleshooting Guide

This guide addresses common issues with losing connection to the Maslow during firmware updates and provides solutions for recovery. The information is compiled from the [Maslow CNC Forums](https://forums.maslowcnc.com/c/troubleshooting/12) community discussions.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. Connection Lost During Firmware Update

**Problem**: The application loses connection to the Maslow while updating firmware, leaving the device in an unknown state.

**Related Forum Discussions**:
- [Loss of connection during firmware update](https://forums.maslowcnc.com/t/loss-of-connection-during-firmware-update/24304) - 7 replies about connection issues during updates
- [Installing firmware 1.0+ video is hard to find](https://forums.maslowcnc.com/t/installing-firmware-1-0-video-is-hard-to-find/24561) - 6 replies about firmware installation difficulties

**Immediate Solutions**:
1. **Don't Panic**: The device is likely recoverable even if the connection was lost
2. **Wait 2-3 Minutes**: Allow any ongoing flash process to complete
3. **Check LED Status**: Look for status indicators on the control board
4. **Try Reconnecting**: Attempt to reconnect using the same COM port
5. **Power Cycle if Necessary**: If completely unresponsive, carefully power cycle the device

### 2. Firmware Update Completely Fails

**Problem**: Firmware update fails to start or complete, potentially leaving the device in bootloader mode.

**Related Forum Discussions**:
- [Firmware version? Help!](https://forums.maslowcnc.com/t/firmware-version-help/24510) - 3 replies about firmware version issues

**Solutions**:
1. **Check USB Cable**: Ensure you're using a data-capable USB cable, not just power
2. **Verify COM Port**: Confirm you're connected to the correct COM port
3. **Close Other Applications**: Ensure no other software is using the serial port
4. **Run as Administrator**: Try running Ground Control with administrator privileges
5. **Check Antivirus**: Temporarily disable antivirus that might block the update process

### 3. Device Becomes Unresponsive After Failed Update

**Problem**: The Maslow becomes completely unresponsive and doesn't appear in device manager or Ground Control.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Device Manager**: Look for unrecognized devices or devices with errors
2. **Try Different USB Port**: Use a different USB port, preferably USB 2.0
3. **Install/Update Drivers**: Ensure Arduino-compatible drivers are properly installed
4. **Force Bootloader Mode**: Use the reset button sequence to force bootloader mode
5. **Manual Firmware Recovery**: Use Arduino IDE or similar tools for manual firmware flashing

### 4. Partial Firmware Update With Communication Errors

**Problem**: Firmware update partially completes but results in communication errors or unexpected behavior.

**Solutions**:
1. **Full Firmware Reflash**: Completely reflash the firmware rather than partial update
2. **Clear EEPROM**: Reset all stored settings that might be corrupted
3. **Check Baud Rate**: Verify communication settings match firmware expectations
4. **Restart Ground Control**: Close and reopen Ground Control after firmware changes
5. **Recalibrate System**: Perform full recalibration after firmware update

## Step-by-Step Recovery Process

### When Connection is Lost During Update:

1. **Stay Calm**: Don't immediately disconnect or power off the device
2. **Wait for Completion**: Allow 2-3 minutes for any ongoing process to finish
3. **Check Board Status**: Look for LED indicators showing current state
4. **Attempt Reconnection**: 
   - Close Ground Control
   - Wait 10 seconds
   - Reopen Ground Control
   - Try to connect to the same COM port
5. **Check Device Manager**: Verify the device is still recognized by Windows/Mac/Linux
6. **Try Different Software**: If Ground Control won't connect, try Arduino IDE to check communication

### If Device Becomes Completely Unresponsive:

1. **Power Cycle Process**:
   - Disconnect USB cable
   - Wait 30 seconds
   - Reconnect USB cable
   - Wait for device recognition sounds/notifications
2. **Check Device Recognition**:
   - Open Device Manager (Windows) or equivalent
   - Look for Arduino-compatible device
   - Note any error symbols or unknown devices
3. **Driver Verification**:
   - Ensure Arduino drivers are installed
   - Update drivers if necessary
   - Try different USB cable
4. **Bootloader Recovery**:
   - Locate reset button on control board
   - Hold reset while connecting USB
   - Release reset after connection
   - Attempt firmware upload using Arduino IDE

### Manual Firmware Recovery Using Arduino IDE:

1. **Download Arduino IDE**: Get the latest version from arduino.cc
2. **Install Board Definitions**: Add appropriate board definitions for your Maslow controller
3. **Locate Firmware Files**: Download the correct firmware version for your Maslow
4. **Set Board Configuration**:
   - Select correct board type
   - Choose appropriate COM port
   - Set correct programmer settings
5. **Upload Firmware**:
   - Open firmware .ino file
   - Click Upload
   - Monitor for successful completion
6. **Verify Communication**: Test basic communication with Ground Control

## Prevention Best Practices

### Before Starting Firmware Update:

1. **Stable Connection**: Ensure USB cable is secure and high-quality
2. **Close Other Programs**: Exit any software that might use the serial port
3. **Disable Power Management**: Turn off USB selective suspend in Windows
4. **Check Power Supply**: Ensure adequate power to the control board
5. **Backup Current Firmware**: Note current firmware version for recovery reference

### During Firmware Update:

1. **Don't Disturb Connection**: Avoid moving USB cable or computer
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for progress indicators and error messages
3. **Be Patient**: Allow adequate time for upload completion
4. **Avoid Interruption**: Don't use computer for intensive tasks during update
5. **Stay Near Computer**: Monitor the process for any issues

### After Firmware Update:

1. **Verify Version**: Confirm new firmware version is correctly installed
2. **Test Basic Functions**: Check basic movement and communication
3. **Recalibrate if Needed**: Some firmware updates require recalibration
4. **Save Settings**: Backup any custom settings or configurations
5. **Document Changes**: Note what firmware version was installed and when

## Common Error Messages and Solutions

### "Port busy" or "Access denied"
- **Cause**: Another application is using the serial port
- **Solution**: Close all applications, restart Ground Control, try again

### "Upload failed" or "Not in sync"
- **Cause**: Communication timing issues or incorrect settings
- **Solution**: Check baud rate, try different USB port, restart both devices

### "Device not found" or "No response"
- **Cause**: Driver issues or hardware problem
- **Solution**: Reinstall drivers, try different cable, check device manager

### "Verification failed"
- **Cause**: Corrupted upload or communication errors
- **Solution**: Retry upload, check USB cable, use Arduino IDE for manual upload
