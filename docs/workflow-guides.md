# Design to G-Code Workflows

This guide covers complete workflows from initial design concept to cutting G-code, using various software combinations popular in the Maslow community.

## Workflow Overview

A typical CNC workflow involves these steps:
1. **Design Creation** - CAD software or image preparation
2. **Toolpath Generation** - CAM software processing
3. **G-Code Export** - Machine-specific code generation
4. **File Validation** - Testing and verification
5. **Machine Execution** - Running the job

## Popular Software Combinations

### Fusion 360 Workflow (Recommended for Beginners)

Fusion 360 provides integrated CAD and CAM in one package, making it ideal for those starting with CNC.

#### Getting Started with Fusion 360
- **Free personal license** available for non-commercial use
- **Cloud-based**: Access designs anywhere
- **Integrated CAD/CAM**: No file format conversions needed
- **Large community**: Extensive tutorials and support

#### Basic Fusion 360 Workflow
1. **Create 2D Sketch** or import image/DXF
2. **Extrude to 3D** if needed for visualization
3. **Switch to CAM workspace**
4. **Create toolpaths**:
   - Contour for outside edges
   - Pocket for material removal
   - Drilling for holes
5. **Post-process** to generate G-code
6. **Simulate** toolpaths before export

#### Fusion 360 Tips for Maslow
- **Use conservative speeds**: Start with 1000mm/min feed rates
- **Minimize rapid movements**: Reduce wear on chains/belts
- **Plan efficient tool changes**: Group operations by tool
- **Check material clearance**: Ensure adequate Z-height

### Inkscape + Estlcam Workflow

This combination is excellent for 2D designs, especially those starting from images or artistic designs.

#### Software Requirements
- **Inkscape**: Free vector graphics editor
- **Estlcam**: Affordable CAM software with excellent 2D capabilities

#### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Image Preparation in Inkscape**
1. **Import image** (JPG, PNG, etc.)
2. **Trace bitmap** to create vector paths
3. **Clean up vectors**: Remove unnecessary nodes
4. **Organize layers**: Separate cutting operations
5. **Export as DXF** for CAM software

**Phase 2: Toolpath Generation in Estlcam**
1. **Import DXF** from Inkscape
2. **Assign cutting operations**:
   - Cutting (for through cuts)
   - Engraving (for surface marking)
   - Pocketing (for material removal)
3. **Set cutting parameters**:
   - Tool diameter and type
   - Cut depth and step-down
   - Feed rates and spindle speed
4. **Generate toolpaths** and preview
5. **Export G-code** for Maslow

#### Best Practices
- **Simplify complex images**: Too much detail creates excessive toolpaths
- **Check vector direction**: Ensure consistent cutting direction
- **Test with small samples**: Verify settings before full cuts
- **Organize by tool**: Minimize tool changes

### CorelDraw + Carbide Create Workflow

This workflow combines professional design tools with user-friendly CAM software.

#### Software Overview
- **CorelDraw**: Professional vector graphics suite
- **Carbide Create**: Free, intuitive CAM software

#### Workflow Steps

**Design Phase (CorelDraw)**
1. **Create or import design** in CorelDraw
2. **Prepare vectors**: Ensure clean, closed paths
3. **Set appropriate dimensions**: Scale to final size
4. **Export as SVG or DXF**: Maintain vector format

**CAM Phase (Carbide Create)**
1. **Import design file** into Carbide Create
2. **Set stock dimensions**: Match your material
3. **Create toolpaths**:
   - Contour for outlines
   - Pocket for recesses
   - Text for engraving
4. **Configure cutting parameters**
5. **Simulate and verify** toolpaths
6. **Export G-code** for your machine

#### Advantages
- **Professional design tools**: Advanced vector manipulation
- **User-friendly CAM**: Intuitive interface for beginners
- **Good simulation**: Preview cuts before machining
- **Free CAM software**: No additional cost for toolpath generation

## Alternative Software Options

### Free and Open Source Options

#### FreeCAD + Path Workbench
- **Completely free**: Open source CAD and CAM
- **Learning curve**: More complex than commercial options
- **Full parametric**: Powerful for mechanical designs
- **Active development**: Continuously improving

#### Inkscape + CamBam
- **2D focus**: Excellent for artistic and decorative work
- **Affordable**: CamBam has reasonable licensing
- **Good community**: Active user forums

#### GIMP + Image2gcode
- **Image processing**: Start with photographs or artwork
- **Heightmap generation**: Create 3D surfaces from grayscale
- **Free workflow**: No software costs

### Commercial Options

#### Vectric Software (VCarve, Aspire)
- **CNC-specific**: Designed for woodworking CNC
- **Excellent toolpaths**: Optimized for quality results
- **Great support**: Professional documentation and training
- **Higher cost**: Significant investment

#### MasterCAM

## Workflow Optimization Tips

### Design Phase
- **Start simple**: Begin with basic shapes before complex designs
- **Consider manufacturing**: Design with your tools and capabilities in mind
- **Plan material usage**: Optimize layout to minimize waste
- **Document dimensions**: Keep track of critical measurements

### CAM Phase
- **Conservative parameters**: Start with slower speeds and lighter cuts
- **Tool selection**: Match tools to material and desired finish
- **Efficient toolpaths**: Minimize air cutting and rapid moves
- **Safety margins**: Leave adequate clearance and escape routes

### Testing and Validation
- **Dry run first**: Test without cutting to verify movements
- **Small test cuts**: Verify settings with sample material
- **Check dimensions**: Measure test pieces before full production
- **Document successful settings**: Keep records of what works

## Common Workflow Problems

### Design Issues
**Problem**: Design too complex for CNC capabilities
**Solution**: Simplify design, break into multiple operations

**Problem**: Dimensions don't transfer correctly between software
**Solution**: Double-check units and scaling in each step

**Problem**: Vectors not suitable for machining
**Solution**: Clean up paths, ensure closed curves where needed

### CAM Issues
**Problem**: Toolpaths take too long to generate
**Solution**: Reduce detail level, increase stepover distances

**Problem**: Cutting parameters cause poor results
**Solution**: Research material-specific settings, start conservative

**Problem**: G-code file too large for controller
**Solution**: Reduce precision in CAM software, break into smaller files

## Material-Specific Workflows

### Plywood and MDF
- **Sharp tools**: Clean cuts require sharp bits
- **Dust collection**: Plan for chip evacuation
- **Edge quality**: Consider climb vs conventional milling
- **Tear-out prevention**: Use backing boards for through cuts

### Hardwood
- **Slower speeds**: Harder materials need reduced feed rates
- **Grain direction**: Plan toolpaths considering wood grain
- **Heat management**: Avoid overheating tools and material
- **Finishing passes**: Light final passes for smooth finish

### Plastics
- **Heat considerations**: Avoid melting from excessive speed
- **Chip evacuation**: Prevent welding of chips to work
- **Tool selection**: Use plastic-specific cutting tools
- **Cooling**: Consider mist cooling for some materials
