# Infinite Fitness Loops & Advanced Calibration Troubleshooting

This guide addresses the complex issues of infinite fitness loops and advanced calibration problems in Maslow CNC systems. Information compiled from [Maslow CNC Forums](https://forums.maslowcnc.com/c/troubleshooting/12) and real troubleshooting cases.

## Understanding Infinite Fitness Loops

### What is a Fitness Loop?

A "fitness loop" occurs when the Maslow calibration process gets stuck attempting to improve the calibration fitness score but never converges to an acceptable value. The system repeatedly tries to adjust parameters without achieving the target fitness threshold.

**Symptoms:**
- Calibration process runs for excessive time (hours)
- Fitness score remains below 0.5 or doesn't improve
- System appears to be measuring points repeatedly
- Calibration never completes or reaches "Calibration Complete" status
- Browser may show spinning indicators indefinitely

### Common Causes of Infinite Fitness Loops

1. **Frame Dimension Errors**
   - Incorrect frame measurements in configuration
   - Frame not actually square or properly built
   - Motor spacing doesn't match entered values

2. **Physical Setup Issues**
   - Sled hitting frame boundaries during calibration
   - Inconsistent chain lengths or belt tension
   - Obstructions preventing proper sled movement

3. **Hardware Problems**
   - Encoder connection issues
   - Motor performance problems
   - Chain/belt slipping during measurement

## Frame Size and Calibration Errors

### Frame Size Error Diagnosis

From the serial log analysis, a common error pattern shows:

```
[MSG:INFO: Center point deviation: TL: -0.036 TR: -0.035 BL: 225.944 BR: 214.358]
[MSG:ERR: Center point deviation over 100.000mmm, your coordinate system is not accurate, adjust your frame dimensions and restart.]
[MSG:ERR: Frame size error, try entering larger frame dimensions and restart.]
```

**What This Means:**
- The system detected major deviations in the bottom corners (BL: 225.944, BR: 214.358)
- Top corners show minimal deviation (TL: -0.036, TR: -0.035)
- Frame dimensions entered don't match physical reality

### Solutions for Frame Size Errors

#### 1. Measure and Verify Frame Dimensions

**Critical Measurements:**
- Motor-to-motor distance (measure center of sprocket to center of sprocket)
- Motor height above work surface
- Work surface dimensions
- Frame angle (should be 15° ± 5°)

**Measurement Tips:**
- Use a laser measure for accuracy
- Measure to bolt centers, not inside edges
- Account for mounting hardware thickness
- Verify frame is actually square

#### 2. Adjust Configuration Values

Update these key parameters:
- `maslow_calibration_grid_width_mm_X`: Actual work surface width
- `maslow_calibration_grid_height_mm_Y`: Actual work surface height
- Motor spacing values in maslow.yaml
- Frame anchor point coordinates

#### 3. Frame Construction Issues

**Common Problems:**
- Top beam bowing under chain tension
- Frame not rigid enough
- Improper mounting of motors
- Incorrect frame angle

**Solutions:**
- Add front-to-back stiffening to top beam
- Ensure motors are mounted solidly
- Check that frame maintains proper angle under load
- Consider upgrading to 12' beam for better geometry

#### Troubleshooting Steps for Low Fitness

1. **Verify Physical Setup**
   ```
   - Chain/belt routing is correct
   - Sled moves freely across entire work area
   - No binding or catching during movement
   - Ring height properly set for sled balance
   ```

2. **Check Motor Performance**
   ```
   - All encoders responding correctly
   - Motors moving in correct directions
   - No skipped steps during movement
   - Consistent motor current (watch for overcurrent errors)
   ```

3. **Calibration Grid Considerations**
   ```
   - Start with smaller grid (5x5 or 3x3) for testing
   - Ensure grid fits within usable cutting area
   - Avoid corners where geometry becomes problematic
   - Consider offset from center if needed
   ```

### Motor Current Exceeded Errors

**Error Pattern:**
```
Motor current on Bottom Right axis exceeded threshold of 4000
```

**Common Causes:**
- Belt/chain tension too high due to poor calibration
- Sled hitting obstacles or frame limits
- Wrong arm configuration or assembly
- Z-axis height incorrectly set

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Assembly:**
   - Verify arm stacking sequence is correct
   - Ensure all bolts are properly tightened
   - Check that arms aren't hitting frame uprights

2. **Reset Z-Stop Position:**
   - Lower Z-axis completely to bottom
   - Press the Z-stop reset button in interface
   - This recalibrates the Z-axis reference point

3. **Belt/Chain Management:**
   - Inspect for doubled-over or twisted belts/chains
   - Ensure proper routing through pulleys
   - Check for obstructions in belt path

### Endless Calibration in Corners

**Problem:** Calibration gets stuck in bottom right corner with sled lifting off surface.

**Related Issues:**
- [Endless Calibration stuck in bottom right corner](https://forums.maslowcnc.com/t/endless-calibration-always-gets-stuck-in-bottom-right-corner-lifting-sled-unsure-where-to-go-now/24479)
- [Sled lifting off the work surface](https://forums.maslowcnc.com/t/sled-lifting-off-the-work-surface/24591)

**Solutions:**
1. **Sled Weight and Balance**
   - Ensure adequate sled weight (typically 25-35 lbs)
   - Check ring height is properly set
   - Add weight if sled tends to lift

2. **Frame Geometry**
   - Consider lowering work surface position
   - Check if 12' top beam would improve geometry
   - Verify frame angle is optimal (15°)

3. **Belt/Chain Tension**
   - Adjust tension management system
   - Check counterweight or bungee setup
   - Ensure even tension across all attachment points

## Systematic Troubleshooting Workflow

### When Calibration Fails or Loops

#### Phase 1: Basic Verification
1. **Stop Current Process**
   - Emergency stop if calibration is running
   - Power cycle the system completely
   - Clear any error states

2. **Physical Inspection**
   - Check all connections are secure
   - Verify sled moves freely by hand
   - Inspect chain/belt routing and condition
   - Confirm frame is stable and square

3. **Configuration Check**
   - Verify frame dimensions match physical setup
   - Check motor spacing measurements
   - Confirm work surface dimensions

#### Phase 2: Systematic Testing
1. **Test Motors Individually**
   - Use manual jog controls to test each motor
   - Verify encoders report position correctly
   - Check for consistent motor behavior

2. **Reduce Calibration Scope**
   - Try 3x3 or 5x5 grid instead of full grid
   - Focus calibration in center area initially
   - Avoid problematic corner regions

3. **Monitor During Calibration**
   - Watch for specific points where failure occurs
   - Note any error messages in console
   - Record fitness scores at each measurement

#### Phase 3: Advanced Diagnosis
1. **Connection Quality**
   - Check for loose encoder connections
   - Verify motor current thresholds
   - Test continuity on all motor/encoder wires

2. **Electrical Interference**
   - Separate power cables from signal cables
   - Check for EMI from spindle/router
   - Consider UPS or power filtering if needed

3. **Frame Modifications**
   - Consider frame stiffening if needed
   - Evaluate need for larger frame (12' beam)
   - Check motor mounting rigidity

## Prevention and Best Practices

### Frame Setup Best Practices
- **Build oversized frames** (12' beam with 30" motor offset) for better corner performance
- **Ensure rigid construction** with proper front-to-back bracing
- **Use precise measurements** when entering configuration values
- **Test frame stability** under full chain/belt tension before calibration

### Calibration Best Practices
- **Start with center-focused grids** before attempting full work area
- **Verify encoder functionality** before beginning calibration
- **Monitor system behavior** throughout calibration process
- **Document successful settings** for future reference

### Maintenance Considerations
- **Regular connection checks** - especially encoder connections
- **Monitor motor current trends** during operation
- **Keep detailed logs** of successful calibration parameters
- **Inspect chain/belt condition** regularly for wear or damage
