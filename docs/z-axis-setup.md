# Z-Axis Setup and Probing Guide

Proper Z-axis setup is crucial for consistent cutting depth and successful automated operations. This guide covers manual zeroing, Z-probe setup, and automation techniques.

## Understanding Z-Axis Operations

The Z-axis controls cutting depth and is responsible for:
- **Initial tool positioning**: Setting proper starting height
- **Depth control**: Maintaining consistent cutting depth
- **Tool changes**: Lifting for safety during moves
- **Surface probing**: Automatically finding work surface

## Manual Z-Axis Zeroing

### The Paper Method (Most Common)

This simple technique works for most situations and requires no special equipment.

#### What You Need
- Single sheet of standard copy paper (0.1mm thick)
- Router with cutting bit installed
- Patience and steady hands

#### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Position the router** above your material
2. **Lower Z-axis** until bit is close to surface (2-3mm)
3. **Place paper** between bit and material surface
4. **Jog Z-axis down slowly** in small increments (0.1mm)
5. **Test paper movement** - it should drag slightly but not tear
6. **Set Z-zero** when paper drags consistently
7. **Remove paper** and you're ready to cut

#### Tips for Success
- **Use consistent pressure** when testing paper drag
- **Move paper in same direction** each time
- **Account for paper thickness** if extreme precision needed
- **Practice the technique** until comfortable

### Alternative Manual Methods

#### Feeler Gauge Method
- **More precise** than paper method
- **Use 0.1mm feeler gauge** for consistent thickness
- **Follow same process** as paper method
- **Better for hard materials** where paper might compress

#### Touch-Off Block Method
- **Use precision ground block** of known thickness
- **Subtract block thickness** from Z-zero position
- **Most accurate manual method**
- **Requires investment** in quality touch-off block

## Automated Z-Probing

Automated probing dramatically improves consistency and saves time, especially for production work.

### Z-Probe Types

#### Touch Plate Probes
**Simple and reliable** - most common type
- **Conductive plate** connected to controller input
- **Tool touches plate** to complete circuit
- **Controller detects contact** and sets zero
- **Typical thickness**: 10-20mm for easy handling

#### Spring-Loaded Probes
**Professional grade** - most accurate
- **Mechanical contact** with spring return
- **Consistent trigger force**
- **Better repeatability** than touch plates
- **Higher cost** but worth it for precision work

### Z-Probe Setup for Maslow M4

The M4 has built-in Z-probe support making setup straightforward.

#### Required Components
- **Conductive touch plate** (aluminum or steel)
- **Wire connections** to controller probe input
- **Alligator clips** for easy bit connection

#### Wiring Setup
1. **Connect plate wire** to probe input on controller
2. **Connect bit wire** to spindle/router body or collet
3. **Verify connections** with multimeter (should show continuity)
4. **Test circuit** before first use

#### Software Configuration
1. **Enable Z-probe** in WebControl settings
2. **Set probe thickness** (measure your plate accurately)
3. **Configure probe speed** (slow for accuracy)
4. **Set safety retract distance**

### M4 Z-Probe Instructions

Based on community documentation, here's the complete setup process:

#### Physical Setup
1. **Mount touch plate** on work surface
2. **Connect probe wire** to designated input
3. **Attach alligator clip** to router spindle or collet
4. **Verify electrical continuity**

#### Calibration Process
1. **Jog router** above touch plate
2. **Initiate probe cycle** in WebControl
3. **Router moves down** until contact detected
4. **Automatic retract** and final positioning
5. **Z-zero set** accounting for plate thickness

## Advanced Z-Axis Techniques

### Multi-Point Probing

For uneven work surfaces, probe multiple points to create a height map.

#### Process
1. **Define probe grid** across work area
2. **Probe each point** automatically
3. **Software interpolates** between points
4. **G-code automatically adjusted** for surface variations

#### Benefits
- **Compensates for material warping**
- **Accounts for frame flex**
- **Improves cut consistency** across large areas

### Tool Change Automation

Automate tool changes with consistent Z-setting.

#### Tool Change Process
1. **Pause program** at tool change command
2. **Retract to safe height**
3. **User changes tool**
4. **Automatic re-probing** sets new tool Z-zero
5. **Program resumes** with correct offset

## Safety Considerations

### Probe Safety
- **Always verify connections** before probing
- **Set conservative speeds** for initial testing
- **Keep emergency stop accessible**
- **Test probe function** before each session

### Router Safety
- **Ensure router is off** during manual zeroing
- **Use sharp bits** for accurate probing
- **Check bit tightness** regularly
- **Maintain proper speeds** for probing operations

## Troubleshooting Z-Axis Issues

### Common Problems

#### Probe Not Triggering
**Symptoms**: Router continues down past touch plate
**Solutions**:
- Check electrical connections
- Verify probe input configuration
- Test continuity with multimeter
- Clean contact surfaces

#### Inconsistent Probing
**Symptoms**: Different Z-zero positions each time
**Solutions**:
- Check for loose mechanical connections
- Verify probe plate is flat and clean
- Adjust probe speed (slower = more accurate)
- Check for electrical interference

#### False Triggering
**Symptoms**: Probe triggers before contact
**Solutions**:
- Check for short circuits in wiring
- Shield probe wires from motor cables
- Verify ground connections
- Use twisted pair wire for probe circuit

### Material-Specific Considerations

#### Conductive Materials
- **Metal workpieces**: May interfere with electrical probing
- **Use insulated touch plate**
- **Alternative**: Use mechanical probe instead

#### Rough Surfaces
- **Uneven contact**: May cause inconsistent readings
- **Surface preparation**: Light sanding can help
- **Multiple probe points**: Average readings for better accuracy

## Workflow Integration

### CAM Software Setup
- **Account for probe thickness** in tool paths
- **Set appropriate clearance heights**
- **Plan tool changes** at convenient locations
- **Include probing commands** in G-code

### Production Workflow
1. **Material prep** and workholding
2. **Initial Z-probe** to establish reference
3. **Run first operation**
4. **Tool change and re-probe** if needed
5. **Continue with remaining operations**
