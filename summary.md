- **Shell**: PowerShell
- **Working Directory**: `C:\Users\josia\projects\maslowcnc`
- **Node.js**: Required version 18.0+

### Docusaurus Configuration
- **Version**: 3.8.1 (latest)
- **Template**: Classic
- **Development Server**: Running on `http://localhost:3333`
- **Port**: 3333 (changed from default 3000 due to port conflict)
